### Version: 0.2.1
**ID:** 2090c6f
**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Module:** Machine Learning - Data Generation
**Author:** Mohammad Hasnain Raza

#### Description of Change:
- Created a new script, `augment_with_paraphrasing.py`, that uses a pre-trained T5 transformer model to paraphrase and augment the existing dataset.
- The script loads the dataset generated by `generate_slot_dataset.py`, generates multiple unique rephrasings for each command, and creates new data points while preserving the original intent and slot values.

#### Enhancement Over Previous Version (v0.2.0):
- **Addresses Dataset Brittleness**: This directly solves the limitation of the template-based approach. By generating AI-powered paraphrases, the dataset becomes far more diverse and less predictable, better reflecting the variability of human language.
- **Improved Model Robustness**: Training on this augmented data will force the NLU model to learn the underlying semantic meaning of commands rather than simply memorizing sentence structures.

### Version: 0.2.0
**ID:** 2090c6f
**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Module:** Machine Learning - Data Generation
**Author:** Mohammad Hasnain Raza

#### Description of Change:
- Redesigned the data generation script (`generate_slot_dataset.py`) to support joint intent classification and slot filling.
- Implemented a centralized, schema-driven architecture where intents are defined with associated slots (e.g., `degrees`, `altitude`), templates, and realistic value sets.
- The output format is now a structured JSONL file containing distinct `text`, `intent`, and `slots` fields.

#### Enhancement Over Previous Version (v0.1.0):
- **Architectural Leap**: This update transitions the NLU task from simple intent classification to a more advanced structured information extraction model.
- **Expanded Capability**: The system is no longer limited to boolean (on/off) commands. It can now be trained to understand and extract parameters/values from pilot commands.
- **Scalability**: The new schema makes it significantly easier to add new, complex commands in the future without major code rewrites.
